%This script performs a McNemar-Bowker test for symmetry on a kxk
%contingency table. You need to enter your data as a matrix
%and call the function BowkerTest, which I got from the Matlab website and saved as a function called BowkerTest (NOTE: I DID NOT WRITE THIS CODE!! link here:https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6322-bowkertest?s_tid=srchtitle)Let's see if this works.

%For the Von Frey Withdrawal data we had 4 possible outcomes so a 4x4
%contingency table, so create a 4x4 matrix with your data saved. These were
%pre-calculated in excel spreadsheet LWSummary, available on my
%PennBox/LabArchives page.
%Here's the pre-SNI vs Post-SNI data

SNI = [1 1 0 0;1 1 1 0; 2 0 0 2;1 1 2 0]
%Here's the Saline vs CNO data
Drug = [1 1 0 3;0 0 1 0;1 1 0 1;1 1 1 0]

%Perform Bowker Test analysis on contingency table for SNI pre/post data.
%Call function BowkerTest(Matrix,tails_of_test,alpha_value)
%For tails_of_test, enter 1 to run a 1-tailed test, enter 2 to run a
%2-tailed test. For alpha_value, enter the acceptable Type1 error rate.
BowkerTest(SNI,2,0.05) %Returned for these as p=0.5438; df=6; b=5
BowkerTest(Drug,2,0.05)%Returned for these as p=0.6767; df=6; b=4
